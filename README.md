# Food Trends Understanding Customer Preferences
## Project Overview:

This project was developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship. It focuses on analyzing customer food ordering behaviour and preferences in the Food & Beverage (F&B) domain using data analytics and visualization techniques. The project transforms raw customer data into meaningful insights through interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Files:

Power BI dashboard files containing customer behavior analysis

Dataset used for customer food ordering behaviour analysis

Project documentation and reports

README file explaining project structure and insights

## Key Features:

Analysis of dominant food ordering platforms

Customer preference analysis (Veg vs Non-Veg, cuisine choices, taste, quality)

Ordering behaviour analysis across time slots and platforms

Delivery experience and service quality evaluation

Restaurant and cuisine performance insights

Interactive dashboards with filters and slicers for dynamic exploration

## Tools & Technologies:

### Power BI

Interactive dashboard creation

KPI cards, bar charts, column charts

Slicers and filters for City, Gender, and Monthly Income

Basic DAX measures such as AVERAGE and COUNT

### Microsoft Excel

Data entry, cleaning, and validation

Sorting, filtering, and consistency checks

Dataset understanding before Power BI import


## License:

This project is created for educational purposes as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship.

The dataset used is publicly available and utilized only for learning and academic analysis.

## Team Learnings & Outcomes:

Developed end-to-end understanding of the data analytics lifecycle

Gained hands-on experience in Power BI dashboard development

Improved ability to extract insights from customer data

Strengthened data storytelling and visualization skills

Learned structured collaboration and version control practices

## Future Enhancements:

Implement predictive analytics to forecast customer demand and peak ordering periods

Integrate real-time or regularly refreshed data sources

Perform advanced customer segmentation based on ordering behaviour

Expand the dataset to include longer time periods for seasonal trend analysis

Apply machine learning–based customer segmentation (clustering)

## Conclusion:

The project successfully analyzed customer ordering behaviour and food preferences using Power BI dashboards. It converted raw data into meaningful and actionable insights through effective visualization. Key patterns related to ordering platforms, time preferences, service quality, and affordability were clearly identified. The project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics concepts in a real-world scenario.
