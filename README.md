# Food Trends Understanding Customer Preferences
## Project Overview:

This project was developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship. It focuses on analyzing customer food ordering behaviour and preferences in the Food & Beverage (F&B) domain using data analytics and visualization techniques. The project transforms raw customer data into meaningful insights through interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

## Conclusion:

The project successfully analyzed customer ordering behavior and food preferences using interactive Power BI dashboards, transforming raw data into structured, meaningful, and actionable insights. Through systematic data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, the analysis identified clear patterns in ordering platforms, peak time preferences, spending habits, service quality, and affordability trends. The dashboards enabled complex data to be interpreted in a simple and visually intuitive manner, making key insights easy to understand.

Overall, the project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics concepts in a real-world business context. It highlights how effective visualization and analytical reasoning can support better decision-making, improve operational strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction. By converting data into insights, the project showcases the value of data-driven approaches in understanding consumer behavior and optimizing services.
